    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      The aim of the team is to deliver an effective and efficient business
      performance service, ensuring value driven from category and contract
      management. Continuous improvement of commercial processes & procedures
      and meaningful reporting. As part of my Commercial Management Office (CMO)
      role, I am responsible for creating all new NIW and NIW Alpha contracts
      onOracle. I administer all aspects of the Contract Management System
      (Atamis) updating contract data for over 200 live contracts. I also help
      develop and implement policies and procedures and carry out checks to
      ensure best practice procurement processes are complied with, procedural
      consistency has been followed and that legal requirements have been met.
      The Financial & Procurement Delegations (FR009) agreed by the Board must
      also be complied with in all tasks, duties and transactions.
